Intro:
<br>
 Communihealth is an Android Mobile App created specifically for Community Health Nurses. Home visits by community health nurses provide essential care and education directly in patients' homes. These visits are especially beneficial for elderly, disabled, or chronically ill individuals who might struggle to access traditional healthcare settings. Nurses assess health, manage conditions, offer wound care, and educate on health management, taking into account environmental and social factors impacting the patient's well-being. This approach ensures personalized, comprehensive care, promoting long-term health and reducing hospital readmissions.
