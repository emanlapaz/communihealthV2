Intro:
<br>
 Communihealth is an Android Mobile App created specifically for Community Health Nurses. Home visits by community health nurses provide essential care and education directly in patients' homes. These visits are especially beneficial for elderly, disabled, or chronically ill individuals who might struggle to access traditional healthcare settings. Nurses assess health, manage conditions, offer wound care, and educate on health management, taking into account environmental and social factors impacting the patient's well-being. This approach ensures personalized, comprehensive care, promoting long-term health and reducing hospital readmissions. 

<br>
The App:

CommuniHealth uses Firebase for realtime database and photo storage. It also utilizes Google Oauth for logging in gmail users. You can also create your account which will be sent to firebase and use it to sign in. <br>
Upon successful log in, the user will be brought in to the patients list screen where you can view previously added patient and where you can create one. <br>

The add patient screen will require the user to input the patient details as below: <br>
- First and Last Names<br>
- Date of Birth in this format dd/yy/mmmm <br>
- Eircode <br>

The user can also upload an image that will be used as the patient's profile photo. <br>
